# HomeControl
Project to control my home givEnergy battery and tesla car

To make this work you will have to install a bunch of Python packages using 'python3 -m pip install' including pymodbus which you must update to the latest.

Copy example.yml to config.yml and fill in the IP address of your givEnergy dongle and your Tesla username.

When Tesla asks for a login copy the URL from the web browser (that shows error on the page) back into the script and it will be cached after that.
