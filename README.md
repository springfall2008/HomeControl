# HomeControl
Project to control my home givEnergy battery and tesla car

To make this work you will have to install a bunch of Python packages using 'python3 -m pip install' including pymodbus which you must update to the latest
Also fill in the IP address of your givEnergy dongle in the home_control.py and your Tesla username
When Tesla asks for a login copy the URL from the web browser (that shows error on the page) back into the script and it will be cached after that.
